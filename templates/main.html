                Browser makes a request via the internet-the world's largest computer network, 
                to the servers via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">
                <b>HTTP</b></a>. Servers respond with files that the browser displays.
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"><b>HTML</b></a> is the main document type of the web. 
                It stands for <b>Hypertext Markup Language.</b>
                It is made up of text content(what you see), markup(what it looks like) and 
                references ( ex: images, videos and other documents).

            <h3>Introduction to HTML</h3>
          </div>
            <div class="concept-description">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Tag: An HTML tag is contained within angled brackets. Most tags have 
                  an opening tag and a closing tag. Some tags are void and they do not 
                  require a closing tag. Break or <span class="code">Br</span> is an example of a void tag.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening 
                  and closing tags.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element. Ex: image tag = <span class="code">&lt;img 
                  src ="url"&gt;</span> , making links using the anchor tag = <span class="code">&lt;a href"___"&gt;</span>.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Inline vs Block : <span class="code">break</span> and <span class="code">span</span> are inline and <span class="code">p</span> and 
                  <span class="code">div</span> are block. 
                  Inline tag just ends a line whereas the block makes an invisible box
                  around text which can have height and width. Moreover, <span class="code">span</span> and <span class="code">div</span> 
                  contain content and you can attach styles to them to adjust the way
                  they behave.

            <div class="concept-description">
              <p>
                Computers are considered stupid because programmers need to write <b>exactly</b> the 
                way a computer understands or write with correct <b>"syntax"</b>. This is good because 
                it gives you the power and if you know how to talk to a computer you can tell 
                it to do anything you want!

            <li>Not all elements are visible </li>

            <li>All elements are rectangular </li>

          </ul>

          <h3>Tree Like Structure</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-description">
          <ul>
            <li>HTML elements have more elements inside of them. There are boxes inside of 
            boxes and so on surrounded
            by an opening tag and a closing tag.</li>

            <li>When programmers talk about the <b>DOM</b>(Document Object Model) 
            they are talking about the tree like structure of a page. </li>

            <li>HTML is the language of the web and it has syntax and rules which are written in a document using HTML syntax and rules. Basic rules are tags. </li>

            <li>Browser turns them in to elements that turn to a tree that uses DOM. It is a standard convention that interacts with elements in HTML.</li>

            <li>HTML tag creates an element in the DOM that the browser uses to display the page. 
            Element is created from the starting tag and the ending tag. Everything in between is content.</li>

            <li><b>Parent-Child Relationship</b> of HTML elements: Elements inside others have a parent-child relationship while elements with the same parent have a sibling relationship. Styling errors may appear when the nested elements don't line up correctly. For example from <b>line 104</b> to <b>120</b> <span class="code">&lt;div&gt; </span> is the top most element, <span class="code">&lt;ul&gt;</span> is it's child. </li>
            <li> CSS is used to style the elements displayed on the page. HTML tells the browser information on what style to use and where to get it.</li>

            or the general look of the web page.</li>

            <li>A rule is a line of CSS that describes the value that a certain attribute should take. </li>

        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components. It can be hard to get the size of the box 
            just right due to these many components. So we use two techniques to solve sizing issues.<br>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>set size in <b>%</b> </li>

            <li>set the box sizing attribute to border-box for every element </li>

            <li>Adding the display flex rule will allow for divs to appear next to each other</li>

            <li>Repetition causes multiple points of error making it difficult to understand and fix the mistakes.</li>

          <h3>Servers</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            Purpose of servers is to respond to HTTP requests. Web apps live on a server, speaks to HTTP and generates content that your browser requests. For example, when a user enters a url in the address bar the browser sends an HTTP GET reqest to the server. Server deciphers the HTTP request, runs the appropriate handler which either responds with static or dynamic content in the form of an HTML document. Static ones are prewritten. ex: Images, HTML. Dynamic are made on the fly by web applications.  When a web application thats hosted on a server, gets a request it can respond with dynamically generated content. Example of an HTTP request : ____. 
            <ul>
              <li> <b> 100 Continue </b> - the client should continue with its request. </li>
              <li> <b> 200 OK </b> - the request has succeeded. </li>
              <li> <b> 402 payment required </b> - the code is reserved for future use. </li>
              <li> <b> 400 Bad Request </b> - the request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax and the client should not repeat the request without modifications. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>

          <h3>Importance of Validating inputs</h3>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            Validating inputs will help your application to prevent vulnerabilities exploited by malicious users(Ex: instead of a valid input someone can add HTML in our code and interfere).For example "> should not be allowed in the input. This can be fixed by escaping. Using dropdowns can limit what the user can actively enter. The other method is to verify what the users enter and complain if the data is bad. Validation can be done on the server side. Information is sent to the server and validated using a server-side language. In case the validation fails, the response is sent to the client and feedback is given. Client side validation can be done on the client using languages such as JavaScript which allows to validate input as it is being typed. This allows for a richer, more responsive validation. A drawback of this is that if the user turns of Javascript they can easily bypass the validation. So validation should be implemented on both the client side AND the server side. This will allow for the best user experience that is more secure with a fast response.

          <h3>HTML Templates and Abstractions</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            HTML templates' goal is to avoid repitition in HTML. Template library is a library to build complicated strings. jinja templates are just .html files that help to use logical syntax to dynamically change the content.  jinja2 is built into the google appengine. Templates separate different types of code, makes more readable code, more secure websites and HTML is easier to modify.
